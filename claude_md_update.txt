## 🏆 ACTIVE STRATEGIES (9-Coin RSI Portfolio - CORRECTED RSI)

**⚠️ CRITICAL BUG FIXES (Dec 2025):**

**4 Critical Bugs Fixed:**
1. ✅ **RSI Calculation** - Was using SMA instead of Wilder's EMA (matched BingX/TradingView)
2. ✅ **Symbol Matching** - Strategy symbols ('PEPE') didn't match config ('1000PEPE-USDT')
3. ✅ **Field Names** - Strategies returned 'side' but main.py expected 'direction' (KeyError)
4. ✅ **Signal Type** - Strategies returned 'LIMIT' but main.py checked for 'PENDING_LIMIT_REQUEST'

**Impact:** Old results were based on **phantom RSI signals** that don't exist on BingX charts. The buggy SMA-based RSI showed values up to 20 points higher/lower than real Wilder's RSI, generating false crossover signals.

**Example:** Bot saw RSI 66.87 → 62.44 (SHORT signal), but BingX showed max RSI was only 58.23 (no signal).

**Realistic Expectations:**
- Individual coins: +2-9% return over 90 days (realistic)
- Best performer: MELANIA at 31.70x R/R (+9.08% with -0.29% DD)
- Worst performer: TRUMPSOL at 2.10x R/R (consider replacing)
- Average R/R: ~11.5x across 9 coins
- **Portfolio approach still valid** - diversification across 9 coins should smooth returns
