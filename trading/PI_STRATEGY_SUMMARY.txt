Direction Split:

- SHORT: +0.30% (8% of profits)

ENTRY CONDITIONS
================

LONG (Buy Panic):
1. RSI(14) < 15 (extreme oversold)
2. Volume > 5.0x 30-bar average
3. Price < EMA(20) by 1.0%+
4. At least 2 of last 3 bars down

SHORT (Sell Euphoria):
1. RSI(14) > 85 (extreme overbought)
2. Volume > 5.0x 30-bar average
3. Price > EMA(20) by 1.0%+
4. At least 2 of last 3 bars up

EXITS
=====
- Take Profit: 1.0% from entry
- Stop Loss: 0.5% from entry (2:1 R:R)
- Max Hold: 60 bars (1 hour)
- Fees: 0.10% round-trip

CONFIGURATION
=============
{
    'rsi_oversold': 15,
    'rsi_overbought': 85,
    'min_volume': 5.0,
    'min_ema_dist': 1.0,
    'tp_pct': 1.0,
    'sl_pct': 0.5,
    'max_hold': 60
}

WHY IT WORKS
============
1. Ultra-selectivity - Only extreme moves where edge is clear
2. Volume confirms conviction - 5x+ volume = real panic/euphoria
3. Mean reversion edge - PI always returns to EMA(20) after extremes
4. LONG bias - Buying panic works better than shorting euphoria
5. Tight risk management - 2:1 R:R with high win rate

KEY INSIGHTS
============
- PI is VERY STABLE (0.087% avg body vs 0.4%+ for meme coins)
- Standard strategies fail - edge too small to beat fees
- Mean reversion works better than momentum
- Strong trends REVERSE (opposite of meme coins!)
- Need extreme filters (RSI 15/85, Vol 5x+) for sufficient edge
