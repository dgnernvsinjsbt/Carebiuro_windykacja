                          WHAT NOT TO DO
================================================================================

❌ Don't trade breakouts (range coin, not breakout coin)
❌ Don't use market orders (high slippage from sporadic volume)
❌ Don't hold overnight (worst session performance)
❌ Don't expect big moves (avg candle body only 0.074%)
❌ Don't trust BB touches alone (only 8-11% reversion rate)
❌ Don't be greedy (profit factor 0.99x = take profits fast)
