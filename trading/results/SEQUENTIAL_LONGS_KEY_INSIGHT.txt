THE MATH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  56 LOSING TRADES:
    Average loss:        -1.92% per trade
    Total losses:        $4,430.78
    Average loss $:      $79.12 per trade

  1 WINNING TRADE:
    Gain:                +82.46%
    Profit:              $4,592.20

  NET RESULT:            +$161.42  (+1.61%)

THE BRUTAL TRUTH
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  One winner ($4,592) offsets 58 average losses ($79 each)

  This means:

  → You MUST survive 56 losing trades
  → You MUST preserve enough capital ($5,569)
  → You MUST be positioned when the winner arrives
  → You MUST let it run for 11+ days without taking profit
  → You MUST not quit after 20, 30, or 40 losses


THE TIMELINE OF PAIN
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Trade 1-10:   Down to $9,468  (-5.3%)   "This is fine..."
  Trade 11-20:  Down to $8,967  (-10.3%)  "Maybe I should quit..."
  Trade 21-30:  Down to $8,595  (-14.0%)  "This is painful..."
  Trade 31-40:  Down to $8,050  (-19.5%)  "I'm stopping this!"
  Trade 41-50:  Down to $7,861  (-21.4%)  "Why am I still here?"
  Trade 51-56:  Down to $5,569  (-44.3%)  "This was a mistake..."

  Trade 57:     UP TO $10,161   (+1.6%)   "...holy sh*t."


WHY THIS WORKS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  1. GRADUAL SIZING preserved capital
     • Started at 20% position size
     • Increased to 100% by 5th trade
     • By trade 57, had 100% size available

  2. NO TAKE PROFIT let the winner run
     • The move from $0.18 → $0.34 took 11+ days
     • A 20% take profit would have exited at $0.22
     • Would have made $224 instead of $4,592

  3. STOP LOSS at candle low gave room to breathe
     • Position stayed alive during minor dips
     • Only exited when true trend reversal happened


WHY THIS FAILS FOR MOST PEOPLE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  PSYCHOLOGICAL BREAKING POINTS:

  After 10 losses:  "Strategy doesn't work" ❌ QUIT
  After 20 losses:  "I've given it enough tries" ❌ QUIT
  After 30 losses:  "This is clearly broken" ❌ QUIT
  After 40 losses:  "I can't take this anymore" ❌ QUIT
  At -20% drawdown: "I need to protect my capital" ❌ QUIT
  At -30% drawdown: "This is unacceptable risk" ❌ QUIT
  At -44% drawdown: "I'm stopping all trading" ❌ QUIT

  The winner came at Trade 57, after -44% drawdown.

  If you quit at any of these points, you take 100% of the pain
  and 0% of the gain.


THE PARADOX
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  The strategy MATHEMATICALLY works:
    • Positive expected value
    • Profit factor > 1.0
    • Beats buy-and-hold by 56pp

  But PSYCHOLOGICALLY it's torture:
    • 98% loss rate
    • Long losing streaks
    • Deep drawdowns
    • Requires blind faith


WHAT IF YOU USED FIXED 100% SIZING?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Same 56 losses (-1.92% each) = -60% total loss
  Capital remaining: $4,000

  The +82% winner on $4,000 = +$3,280 gain
  Final capital: $7,280 (-27.2% total)

  Same trades, wrong sizing = FAILURE


THE LESSON
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Trading is not about being right often.
  Trading is about being positioned correctly when it matters.

  This strategy:
  ✗ Is wrong 98% of the time
  ✓ Makes money anyway

  But only if you:
  ✓ Survive the losers (gradual sizing)
  ✓ Catch the winner (stay in the game)
  ✓ Let it run (no take profit)
  ✓ Don't quit (discipline)


WHO SHOULD TRADE THIS?
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ✓ Traders who understand statistics
  ✓ Traders who can ignore emotions
  ✓ Traders who have faced 50+ loss streaks before
  ✓ Traders who trust the math more than feelings
  ✓ Traders who can watch -40% drawdowns without panic

  ✗ Beginners
  ✗ Anyone who needs consistent income
  ✗ Anyone who can't handle 98% loss rate
  ✗ Anyone who will quit after 10-20 losses
  ✗ Most traders (honestly)


THE ALTERNATIVE VIEW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  In 90 days of FARTCOIN crashing -54.8%:

  Buy & Hold:            Lost $5,480  (-54.8%)
  Most strategies:       Lost $3,000+ (-30%+)
  Sequential Longs:      Gained $161  (+1.6%)

  The strategy didn't "win big" - it simply DIDN'T LOSE
  when everything else was falling apart.

  That's the real insight.


FINAL THOUGHT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  "The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."

  This strategy flips that on its head:

  "Your position sizing can keep you solvent longer than the market
   can remain irrational."


  November 22, 2025, 16:00 UTC - FARTCOIN was at $0.1846
  One green candle. Entry signal. Position opened.

  56 trades had failed before this.
  Capital was down 44%.
  Most traders would have quit.

  But the strategy didn't quit.
  And 11 days later, it was profitable.
