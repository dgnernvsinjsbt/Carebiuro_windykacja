THE ONE WINNING TRADE (Limit10_Gradual)
================================================================================

Out of 57 trades, only 1 was a winner:

Entry:  2025-11-04 at $0.2713
Gain:   +82.46%
Size:   100% (5th+ trade of day)
Result: This single trade offset 43 losing trades

This is why the strategy works: You survive many small cuts (-1.9% each),
then ONE big winner (+82%) makes you profitable.

================================================================================
BRUTAL TRUTH
================================================================================

⚠️  This strategy has a 98% LOSS RATE
⚠️  You will lose 50+ trades before catching 1 winner
⚠️  Requires EXTREME psychological discipline
⚠️  Most traders will quit before the winner arrives

Can you handle:
- Watching 50 consecutive losses?
- Your account bleeding slowly for weeks?
- Having faith that trade #51 will save you?

If NO → Don't trade this strategy
If YES → Start with Limit3_Gradual (safest)

================================================================================

  • Best risk/reward balance

FOR AGGRESSIVE TRADERS:
→ Limit10_Gradual
  • +1.61% return, 44.3% max drawdown
  • Up to 10 trades/day

================================================================================
WHEN THIS STRATEGY SHINES
================================================================================

✓ Downtrending markets (proven: beat -54% drawdown)
✓ Volatile altcoins (large swings = big winners)

FINAL VERDICT
================================================================================

FOR RESEARCH:      ★★★★★  Excellent case study in low-frequency trading
FOR LIVE TRADING:  ★★☆☆☆  Only for advanced traders with strong psychology
FOR MOST TRADERS:  ★☆☆☆☆  Look elsewhere (too emotionally demanding)

The strategy WORKS mathematically (proven in backtest), but requires
superhuman patience to endure 98% losses while waiting for the 2% winners.

If you can't handle 50 losses in a row, this strategy will break you.
If you can, it might just save you in the next crypto winter.
