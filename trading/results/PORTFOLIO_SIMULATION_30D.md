## Key Findings

### Position Management Impact
- **Capital Locked**: 16 trades (4.7%) were skipped because capital was locked in another position
- **Execution Rate**: Only 95.3% of available signals could be taken
- **Missed Opportunity**: Sum of skipped trade P&Ls = +3.68%

### Portfolio vs Individual Strategies
When each strategy runs independently (their individual backtests):

- Sum of individual strategy returns: **+52.67%**
- Actual portfolio return: **+126.82%**
- **Diversification Impact**: +74.15% (+140.8% change)

### Why Portfolio Return ≠ Sum of Individual Returns
1. **Position Conflicts**: When multiple strategies signal at the same time, only ONE can be taken
2. **Capital Locking**: Once in a position, all other opportunities are skipped until exit
3. **Sequential Execution**: The portfolio simulates ONE trading account, not parallel accounts
4. **Timing Effects**: The order of trades matters - early losses reduce capital for later winners

## Conclusion

The portfolio generated a **+126.82%** return over 30 days with a **-5.88%** max drawdown, resulting in a **21.59x** Return/DD ratio.

✅ **Excellent Risk-Adjusted Returns**: Return/DD ratio > 5x indicates strong performance with controlled drawdowns.


**Recommendation**: The portfolio shows profitable performance suitable for live trading.
