## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS

1. **PENGU is NOT a trend coin**
   - Do NOT use trend-following strategies
   - Do NOT chase breakouts
   - Do NOT expect momentum continuation

2. **Chop Risk is HIGH**
   - 91.76% of time in choppy regime
   - Tight stops will get hit frequently
   - Need high win rate (>55%) to overcome fees

3. **Volume Analysis is WEAK**
   - Volume spikes don't predict direction
   - Volume dry-ups just mean less volatility

4. **Session Timing Matters**
   - US session is best (36.35% long WR)
   - Avoid overnight session (lowest WR)

5. **Fees are a MAJOR factor**
   - With 0.1% round-trip fees, you need >0.2% avg move to profit
   - Many patterns have <0.01% edge—NOT tradable

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS

1. **Backtest a simple BB mean reversion strategy** on PENGU
   - Use BB(20,2) with RSI(14) confirmation
   - Focus on US session only
   - Test on 1-minute data with realistic fees

2. **Paper trade for 1 week** to validate findings
   - Track: Win rate, avg R:R, fees impact
   - Note: Best/worst sessions and days

3. **Compare PENGU to other meme coins**
   - Is this mean-reverting behavior unique to PENGU?
   - Or is this common across low-cap meme coins?

4. **Consider multi-timeframe analysis**
   - Does PENGU trend on 5-min or 15-min charts?
   - Are 1-minute patterns too noisy?
